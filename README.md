# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

## Daily Practice: Fire up the [App](https://codefellows.github.io/dsa-practice) to do a random challenge from the matrix every day!

This test suite is designed for you to practice the mechanics of common data structures. Before you can **problem solve**, it's  important that you have the foundational tools and confidence to implement your solutions.

Use this guide as a means of practicing the raw skills, using the matrix shown below.  You should be able to solve every combination of tasks both **iteratively** and **recursively**

| Given a ___________,     | find_______________                      |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Array                    | max element                               |
| Linked List              | sum of elements                           |
| Stack                    | whether x is contained in it              |
| Queue                    | reversed/sorted/manipulated version of it |
| Tree                     | sum of elements                           |
| BST                      | whether x is contained in it              |
| Iteratively, Recursively | reversed version of it                    |
| Tree                     | sorted version of it                      |
| BST                      |                                           |
